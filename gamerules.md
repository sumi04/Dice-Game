# Dice-Game
Welcome to the dice game of the century! Bucket of Luck is played with three standard dice that are kept in a device shaped somewhat like an hourglass that resembles a wire-frame bird cage and pivots about its center. The dealer rotates the cage end over end, with the dice landing on the bottom.

Wagers are placed based on possible combinations that can appear on the three dice. See the following table for how the payouts work:

Single Die Bet : Betting how many of a given roll will appear. The payout for this bet is 1 to 1 if one die, 2 to 1 if two dice and 10 to 1 if three dice are involed. 

Over 11' : To win this bet the sum of all your dice has to be over 11. The payout for this bet is 1 to 1.

Less than 10' : The sum of all your dice has to be less than 10 if you want to win this bet. The payout for this bet is also 1 to 1. 

Outside 8-12' : The total of the dice should be outside the range of 8 to 12 (inclusive) in order to win. Meaning less than 8 or greater than 12. The payout for this bet is the same as the last two, 1 to 1.
